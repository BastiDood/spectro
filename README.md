# Acknowledgements

Spectro is dedicated to the hundreds of students at the Department of Computer Science, University of the Philippines - Diliman who rely on anonymous confessions for their daily dose of technical discourse, academic inquiries, heated rants, quick-witted quips, and other social opportunities.

Let Spectro bind the wider computer science community closer together in pursuit of collaboration in the service of our nation.

- To the selfless student leaders keeping the spirit of the department alive.
- To the tireless mentors who frequently share their knowledge and gifts to every academic inquiry.
- To the seasoned veterans and alumni who impart their wisdom about the "real world" out there.
- To the harshest critics of the department who only strive for the quality of education that we deserve.
- To the wittiest comedians who brighten up the otherwise dry discourse.
- To the anonymous lurkers who now feel safer and empowered to participate.

Spectro is here is for you. üëª
