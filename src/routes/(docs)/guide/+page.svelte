    <h1 id="getting started" class="font-medium">Getting Started</h1>
    <p>To get started with Spectro, we must first invite the Discord bot into the server.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <Icon icon={BaselineAnnouncement} width={24} />
        <span>Spectro is currently under closed beta.</span>
    </div>

    <h2 id="set-up">Setting up Confession Channels</h2>
    <p>
        By default, Spectro is not configured to send anonymous confessions to any channel. To "set up" a channel for
        confessions, server moderators (i.e., any member with the <span class="badge badge-accent">Manage Channels</span
        >
        permission) must invoke the {@render command('setup')} command with a target <strong>channel</strong> to which all
        confession logs will be sent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Optionally, the <strong>label</strong> and the <strong>color</strong> of the confession embed may be configured.
        The <strong>color</strong> must be a valid RGB color hex code.
    </p>
    <p>
        If prior approval is required before a confession may be published to a confession <strong>channel</strong>, the
        {@render command('setup')} command also has an <strong>approval</strong> flag, which configures whether
        submitted confessions should be put on hold before publication. By default, <strong>approval</strong> is false.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a channel has already been set up for confessions, invoking {@render command('setup')} again will simply overwrite
        the non-empty arguments of the command invocation.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, the following is a minimum checklist of required permissions and configurations for Spectro to
        properly publish confessions.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Spectro must have the <span class="badge badge-accent">Send Messages</span> permission in the target
            <strong>channel</strong> in order to publish confessions.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Optionally, the <span class="badge badge-accent">Attach Files</span> permission is required for sending
                    attachments with the confession.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Spectro should have the <span class="badge badge-accent">Send Messages</span> permission in the log
            <strong>channel</strong> in order to forward confession logs.
        </li>
        <li>
            The server moderator setting up the channel must have the <span class="badge badge-accent"
                >Manage Channels</span
            > permission.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="submit-confessions">Submitting Confessions</h2>
    <p>
        Once a channel has been properly configured, any member with the <span class="badge badge-accent"
            >Send Messages</span
        >
        permission can now invoke the {@render command('confess')} command to publish an anonymous confession. To send an
        attachment along with the confession, the <span class="badge badge-accent">Attach Files</span> permission is required.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <Icon icon={BaselineAnnouncement} width={24} />
        <span>All confessions are logged for moderation purposes.</span>
    </div>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="approve-confessions">Approving Confessions</h2>
    <p>
        For channels that require approval, submitted confessions first go through the configured log <strong
            >channel</strong
        >. While a confession is pending approval in the log <strong>channel</strong>, any server moderator with the
        <span class="badge badge-accent">Manage Messages</span>
        permission can press the <button class="btn btn-success btn-xs">Publish</button> button or the
        <button class="btn btn-error btn-xs">Delete</button>
        button to moderate the confession.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever a pending confession is published/deleted, Spectro logs the timestamp of the interaction and the user
        who triggered the action.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <Icon icon={BaselineAnnouncement} width={24} />
        <span
            >If a confession log message has been deleted, there is no way to recover that original message. This is
            especially consequential for pending confessions should these be accidentally deleted.</span
        >
    </div>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="reply-to-confessions">Replying to Confessions</h2>
    <p>
        Any member with the <span class="badge badge-accent">Send Messages</span> permission can anonymously reply to
        any message in a confessions-enabled <strong>channel</strong>. Simply open the context menu on that message
        (i.e., right-click on desktop and press-and-hold on mobile) and then select the
        <a href="/reference/#reply" class="link link-primary">Apps &gt; Reply Anonymously</a> option. A modal with a text
        area input should pop up on the screen, where the anonymous reply can be drafted.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <Icon icon={BaselineAnnouncement} width={24} />
        <span
            >Attaching a file alongside a message reply is currently unsupported. This feature is blocked on Discord
            finally implementing file select inputs for modal submit components.</span
        >
    </div>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="resend-confessions">Resending Confessions</h2>
    <p>
        In the rare occasion when a confession message gets accidentally deleted, any user with the <span
            class="badge badge-accent">Manage Messages</span
        >
        permission can {@render command('resend')} an already approved and published confession. The invoking user must be
        in the same channel that the confession was originally sent.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="panic-button">The Panic Button: Locking Down Channels</h2>
    <p>
        If the confessions get too heated, server moderators with the <span class="badge badge-accent"
            >Manage Channels</span
        >
        permission can press the panic button and temporarily disable confessions on a channel using the
        {@render command('lockdown')} command. All previous channel settings will be preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
        To re-enable confessions, the {@render command('setup')} command can be invoked again. Note that the log
        <strong>channel</strong> is a required argument. The rest of the optional arguments (e.g.,
        <strong>label</strong>, <strong>color</strong>, and <strong>approval</strong>) will be restored from the
        previous invocation of the {@render command('setup')} command.
    </p>
